# react-survey-app
The aim of the react-survey-app is to provide an easy way of creating a survey/questionnaire/feedback form based on a JSON structure. You can provide a static set of questions or you can provide an API endpoint from which the app will get the JSON. The app will generate  each question based on it's question type(checkbox, radio, text, checkbox with other field, radio with other field), and post the answers to an API endpoint you configure.
